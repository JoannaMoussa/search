# Project 0 - Google Search Replica

This project is a replica of Google Search. It contains 3 pages: Google Search page, Google Image Search page and Google Advanced Search page.

1. On the **Google Search** page, there's an input field where the user inputs a query. There are two submit buttons:
   * `Google Search`: when clicked, the user should be taken to the Google search results page for that query.
   * `I'm Feeling Lucky`: this button will redirect to the first Google search result for the query, bypassing the results page.

1. On the **Google Image Search** page, the user types in a query, clicks a search button and gets Google image search results for that query.

1. On the **Google Advanced Search** page: the user can provide input for the following four fields:
   * *all these words*
   * *this exact word or phrase*
   * *any of these words*
   * *none of these words*

  When the `Advanced Search` button is clicked, the corresponding Google search results for these specifications will be displayed.
